# Department Newsletter

An Rmarkdown that wrangles data from [an open google sheet](http://bit.ly/UASocOpp) about opportunities for graduate students in Sociology into a newsletter format with [soc_opportunities.Rmd](https://github.com/kelseygonzalez/DepartmentNewsletter/blob/main/soc_opportunities.Rmd) and emails it to the department graduate student listserv with [soc_opportunities.R](https://github.com/kelseygonzalez/DepartmentNewsletter/blob/main/soc_opportunities.R).
